# Solana Arbitrage Bot

This project is a high-performance, fully automated arbitrage bot designed for the Solana blockchain. Built in Rust, it continuously monitors multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) to identify and exploit profitable arbitrage opportunities, executing trades autonomously with advanced risk management and optimization features.


## üöÄ Features

### Core Arbitrage Strategies
- **Direct Arbitrage**: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A across different DEXs
- **Triangular Arbitrage**: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A within and across DEXs  
- **Cross-DEX Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences between Orca, Raydium, and Phoenix
- **Multi-hop Route Discovery**: Complex arbitrage paths with multiple intermediate tokens

### Advanced Monitoring
- **Mempool Intelligence**: Real-time transaction monitoring via WebSocket connections
- **Whale Tracking**: Monitor large wallet movements and pre-position for opportunities
- **Front-running Detection**: Analyze pending transactions to act before price movements
- **Deep Orderbook Analysis**: Level 2 depth arbitrage on orderbook DEXs like Phoenix

### Risk Management
- **Simulation Mode**: Test strategies without real transactions
- **Slippage Protection**: Calculate and limit price impact
- **Position Sizing**: Dynamic capital allocation based on liquidity depth
- **Profit Thresholds**: Configurable minimum profit requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against API throttling

### Execution Engine
- **Transaction Simulation**: Pre-validate all trades before execution
- **Priority Fees**: Ensure fast transaction processing
- **Compute Budget Optimization**: Efficient compute unit allocation
- **Multi-step Transaction Building**: Complex arbitrage route execution
- **Confirmation Tracking**: Monitor transaction status until confirmed

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### DEX Integration
- **Orca (Whirlpools)**: Concentrated liquidity pools
- **Raydium**: AMM and orderbook hybrid
- **Phoenix**: Pure orderbook DEX

### Core Components
- **Screener**: Identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities
- **Executor**: Builds and executes transactions
- **Monitor**: Tracks mempool and whale activities
- **RPC Client**: Rate-limited Solana RPC interactions
- **Math Utils**: AMM calculations and profit analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# RPC Configuration
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
QUICKNODE_RPC_URL=your_quicknode_url_here

# Bot Settings
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
PROFIT_THRESHOLD_PERCENT=0.5

### Config File (config.toml)
```toml
[bot]
profit_threshold_percent = 0.5
max_slippage_percent = 1.0
min_liquidity_usd = 10000
execute_trades = false
simulation_mode = true

[dexs]

[monitoring]
mempool_enabled = true
whale_tracking_enabled = true
min_whale_transaction_sol = 10.0
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Solana Arbitrage Bot, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Rust & Cargo
If you don't have Rust and Cargo installed, you can do so using `rustup`:
```bash
curl --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and then edit it with your specific configurations:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**Key variables to configure in `.env`:**
- `SOLANA_RPC_URL`: Your Solana RPC endpoint (e.g., a QuickNode or Ankr URL).
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet's private key for executing trades (be extremely careful with this in live environments).
- `PROFIT_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`: Minimum profit percentage to trigger a trade.
- `SIMULATION_MODE`: Set to `true` for testing without real funds, `false` for live trading.

### 3. Run the Bot

**For testing in simulation mode:**
```bash
cargo run
```

**For live trading (build and run release version):**
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/solana-arbitrage-bot
```

Ensure `EXECUTE_TRADES=true` in your `.env` file for live trading.

## üí° Strategy Overview

### The bot implements a comprehensive arbitrage strategy:

1. **Data Collection**: Continuously fetches pool data from all enabled DEXs
2. **Opportunity Screening**: Analyzes price differences and calculates potential profits
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates liquidity depth, slippage, and confidence scores
4. **Execution Planning**: Builds optimized transaction instructions
5. **Simulation**: Pre-validates transactions to avoid failed trades
6. **Execution**: Sends transactions with priority fees for fast processing
7. **Monitoring**: Tracks confirmation and calculates actual profits

### Key Differentiators

- **Mempool Monitoring**: Act on information before it becomes public
- **Whale Tracking**: Follow large traders to anticipate market movements  
- **Multi-DEX Intelligence**: Simultaneous monitoring of AMM and orderbook DEXs
- **Smart Route Discovery**: Find complex arbitrage paths others miss
- **Risk-Aware Execution**: Comprehensive risk management and position sizing

## üîí Security

- Private keys are loaded from environment variables
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Simulation mode for safe testing
- Configurable risk parameters
- Transaction confirmation tracking

## üìä Performance

- **Low Latency**: Direct WebSocket connections and optimized execution paths
- **High Throughput**: Concurrent monitoring of multiple DEXs
- **Memory Efficient**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and careful resource management
- **Scalable**: Modular architecture allows easy addition of new DEXs and strategies

## üö® Disclaimer

This is experimental software for educational purposes. Arbitrage trading involves significant risks including:
- Smart contract risks
- Market volatility
- Transaction failures
- Slippage and MEV
- Potential loss of funds

Always test thoroughly in simulation mode before risking real capital.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Flash loan integration for capital-free arbitrage
- ML-based opportunity scoring
- Cross-chain arbitrage opportunities  
- Advanced MEV protection strategies
- Real-time performance analytics dashboard
